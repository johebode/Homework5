# Lipophilicity Fingerprint Model

This repository contains a script to train and evaluate a regression model for predicting lipophilicity based on chemical structure fingerprints. The model uses Morgan Fingerprints and MACCS Keys to predict experimental lipophilicity values.

## Project Overview

In this project, we train two models to predict lipophilicity:
1. **Morgan Fingerprints**: A widely used molecular fingerprint method for representing chemical structures.
2. **MACCS Keys**: A predefined set of 166 structural features for molecular characterization.

The model is trained using a **Multilayer Perceptron Regressor (MLPRegressor)** from scikit-learn, with user-defined hyperparameters.

## Contents
- **train_model.py**: Python script for training the regression models using fingerprints. Allows the user to specify hyperparameters such as `max_iter` and `hidden_layer_sizes` via command line arguments.
- **Lipophilicity.csv**: Dataset containing SMILES strings of molecules and their corresponding experimental lipophilicity values (used for training and testing the model).
- **results.txt**: Output file generated by the script containing the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for both the Morgan and MACCS models, along with the conda environment name and hyperparameters used during training.
- **environment.yml**: Conda environment configuration file to create the environment with required dependencies.
